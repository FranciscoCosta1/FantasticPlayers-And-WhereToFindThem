# Fantastic Players And Where To Find Them

Academic Project for the course of **Analyzing and Visualizing Data**

Group: Francisco Costa, Jo√£o Gouveia, Pedro Rivera, Nuno Rocha

Technologies used: **PowerBI, Python** (used to scrape data)

[PowerBI] This project aims to provide key insights regarding this most recent transfer window and, ultimately, find who can be the best substitute for one of your players.

As such, this project will essentially comprise three sections: 
  * **Analysis by league**; 
  * **Analysis per club**;
  * **A player profile page featuring the most similar players to that one.**

The data used in this project was extracted from **FIFA 20 database and Transfermarkt website**.
